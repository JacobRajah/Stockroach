### Prerequisites

The first step in using this software is to download a local copy of the code. The source code can be downloaded directly through GitHub or can be cloned out using git as follows:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JacobRajah/Stockroach.git
```

Once you have a copy of the source code, ensure you have **npm** installed and then run the following command in both the server.js directory and the client directory to install all necessary node modules locally:

```
$ npm install
```

### Running the program

To run the website in development mode, execute the following:

```
$ npm run dev
```

This will start up the UI in your browser at localhost:3000
